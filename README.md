# Hemopi

HemoPI is an in silico method to predict hemolytic property of peptide. It also allows 
users to design better therapeutic peptide analog with desirable hemolytic potencies.
Main Modules of HemoPI Standalone version:

(A) Hemolytic Potency: This tool is helpful to users to predict whether a peptide is hemolytic or not. 
In addtion, it also allows user to generate all possible single mutant analogs of their peptides and predict whether 
that analog is hemolytic or not. Thus in this way, it is helpful for predicting, as well as designing peptides with desirable hemolytic potency.

(B) Virtual Screening: This module allows user to screen and predict hemolytic peptides from large number of submitted peptides.
This tool allows the users to identify highly hemolytic or non-hemolytic peptides from large number peptides (in a batch mode) 
submitted by a user.

(C) Protein Mapping: This module assists users to identify potential hemolytic regions in a given protein sequence. 
It generates all possible overlapping peptides of a protein sequence and their single mutant analogs followed by prediction of 
their hemolytic property.
